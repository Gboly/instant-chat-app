# Inspiration 💡
I wanted to create a privacy centric chat application. As you already know, our chats on most of the applications use our chats to show us personalized ads. So I wanted to create something which doesn't store any data from my users. This application's data should be deleted as the members leave the chat.

# How I built it 🛠
This was my first application which I built while learning Back-end development. I used Node.js for its application environment. I used Express.js for the application framework of the application. Express is helpful for synchronizing frontend and backend parts of the web application. Also, I used websocket for emitting and receiving the messages from multiple users.

# Challenges I ran into 🤒
The biggest challenge was to learn websockets, which is a very large, bidirectional communication protocol. I had to dive deep down in the docs of socket.io. Also, rendering new messages to the interface was a very big challenge.

# What I learnt 📚
 I learnt a lot of Backend development and different technologies. I have now learnt Node.js, Express.js and websockets. I can now use these newly learnt technologies to create more amazing and interesting applications.

# What's next for Instant Chat Application 🙌
Adding support for images is the next step in this application. Also, improving the UI and UX of this application is another thing which I'll be working on.



just testing the github forking process.
